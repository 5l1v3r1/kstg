# Kubernetes Introduction

## Why Kubernetes

A lot of developers have moved or are moving from a traditional world to a container based ecosystem. This allows developers to package their application code, dependencies and required libraries in a simple container and use it anywhere wherever there is a container runtime available.

> An example of a container runtime is Docker

At a minimum, Kubernetes can schedule and run application containers on clusters of physical or virtual machines. However, Kubernetes also allows developers to ‘cut the cord’ to physical and virtual machines, moving from a host-centric infrastructure to a container-centric infrastructure.

This approach provides the full advantages and benefits inherent to containers. Kubernetes provides the infrastructure to build a truly container centric development environment. This is the primary reason developers love it.

## What is Kubernetes

With Kubernetes, you are able to quickly and efficiently respond to customer demand

- Deploy your applications quickly and predictably
- Scale your applications on the fly
- Roll out new features seamlessly
- Limit hardware usage to required resources only
- Our goal is to foster an ecosystem of components and tools that relieve the burden of running applications in public and private clouds

> According to Brian Grant [Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers](http://www.slideshare.net/BrianGrant11/wso2con-us-2015-kubernetes-a-platform-for-automating-deployment-scaling-and-operations).

Kubernetes is

- **Portable**: public, private, hybrid, multi-cloud
- **Extensible**: modular, pluggable, hookable, composable
- **Self-healing**: auto-placement, auto-restart, auto-replication, auto-scaling

> Google started the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes builds upon a [decade and a half of experience that Google has with running production workloads at scale](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43438.html), combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
